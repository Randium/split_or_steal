# Split or Steal
This is an old piece of code that I used to write my own program that would estimate whether to play or not in a certain game, and whether they want to participate in said games. It is a quite primitive but effective application of the evolution learning mechanism.  

Mind you, most variables and text are Dutch. Luckily, the Dutch language is worldwide THE language that resembles English the most, so I'm sure you'll recognize some words in _historie_, _generatie_ and _succes_. ;)
